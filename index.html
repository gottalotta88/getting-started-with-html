  <title>HTML notes</title>
HTML: Hypertext markup language<br>
<p>-Web invented in the 1990s; all pages link together<br>
-Browser makes requests to the internet via HTTP to servers, which respond with files that the browser displays</p>

-<b>Text content</b>: infromation you see<br>
-<b>Markup</b>: what it looks like<br>
-<b>References</b> to other documents: images and videos<br>
-Test out code at <a href ="www.udacity.com/html_playground"> link </a><br>
Opening tags and closing tags; both tags plus contents within is called an element<br>
<ul type = "circle">
  <li>B tag is for bold</li>
  <li>em tag is for italics</li>
  <li>If you don’t close tag; everything after is bolded/italicized</li>
  <li>a is for anchor</li>
    <ul type = "square">
    <li>Used for making links</li>
    <li>Followed by an attribute name, value, and then contents
    </ul>
  <li>img is for image</li>
    <ul type = "square">
    <li>Src and alt are attributes; alt is what to display if broken request
    <li>Img doesn’t have any content, so no closing tag; this is called a void tag, a tag that has no content<li>
    </ul>
  <li>Lines</li>
    <ul type = "square">
    <li>br is a line break to make text go onto next line; also a void tag</li>
    <li>p is for paragraph; need closing tag after content</li>
    <li>Br just puts to next line whereas p tag makes an invisible box; br is an inline element while p is a block element; latter creates blocks on the screen</li>
    <li>Spaces and returns will not be registered</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Span and div</li>
    <ul type = "square">
    <li>Span can be used to give CSS styles to contents; inline element</li>
    <li>Div does the same but as a block element</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus basic HTML vocab consists of <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b>, and <b>attributes</b></p>
